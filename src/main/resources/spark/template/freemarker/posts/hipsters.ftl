                <h3>Stop using EMACS and Vim, hipster</h3>
                
				<p>If you aren't aware of what Emacs and Vim are, they are a pair of text editors used by hipsters and people that haven't released that there might be a reason why GUIs are commonly used. Fans of Emacs or Vim are fans of user-unfriendly, ugly looking, backwards tools that require an ungodly amount of research to open and save a file in.</p>

				<p>Admittedly, I've only had a few minutes of experience with both but I feel it was long enough to get the gist that I already had better ways to type some text. For example, I could use Notepad. I could use Open Office Writer. I could fart a load of Scrabble letters onto a sheet of paper and see what comes up*.</p>

				<p>In general, a simpler idea is a better and more successful idea. It's easier to pot a ball in snooker if you hit the ball towards the pocket rather than banking on it ricocheting it off of three cushions and a migrating flock of birds. As such, it should follow that a simpler text editor is a better editor (to be known from here on out as Occam's Text Editor). Yet somehow, in a blatant disregard for this rule, fans of Emacs and Vim stick to their backwards software.</p>

				<p>Here's a fun challenge for you normal people out there. Download Vim or Emacs and in under three minutes, create a new text document, write "this is ass" and save it <strong>without getting help from the internet or a friend</strong>. If you can, you've clearly used one of these editors before and as such should stop reading five minutes ago incase your feelings get hurt.</p>

				<p>To cap it off, Emacs and Vim users love hurling insults at the other's chosen burden. Highlights include Emacs users claiming Vim either beeps repeatedly or breaks everything and Vim users championing acronyms like "Eventually Munches All Computer Storage". It's almost identical to children insulting other children over their choice in games console, even down to the part where they live with their mums.</p>

				<p>However, I am not one to complain without offering a solution. I propose a gladiatorial arena deathmatch between Vim and Emacs users. Teams of three battle to the death until only one team is left. Then, that group is given a victory parade ending in them being killed off. Then and only then will the World be able to move on from these backwards traditions.</p>.</p>
